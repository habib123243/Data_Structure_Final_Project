This project focuses on Data Structures and incorporates essential concepts in a user-friendly manner. It centers around a Pharmacy Management System, where medicines are organized using the Binary Search Tree algorithm. Additionally, various sorting algorithms have been seamlessly integrated into the system. Furthermore, the project encompasses implementations of arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks.

This endeavor showcases the practical application of data structures in a pharmacy context, enabling efficient management of medication inventory. It also highlights the versatility of sorting algorithms, making it easier to locate and organize medicines. Furthermore, the utilization of arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks enhances the system's functionality, enabling streamlined data manipulation.

This project serves as an educational and practical example of how data structures play a pivotal role in real-world scenarios, such as pharmacy management, and how different algorithms contribute to optimal data organization and retrieval.
